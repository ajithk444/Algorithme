Given a number n, find count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first 
n bits is same as sum of last n bits.

Examples:

Input:  n = 1
Output: 2
There are 2 sequences of length 2*n, the
sequences are 00 and 11

Input:  n = 2
Output: 2
There are 6 sequences of length 2*n, the
sequences are 0101, 0110, 1010, 1001, 0000
and 1111
